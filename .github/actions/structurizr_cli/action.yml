  Call Structurizr CLI with the arguments passed as inputs to the action.  This only works with Commands that need -w (workspace). I made this as a Proof of Concept.

inputs:
  command:
    description: 'Arguments for Structurizr CLI'
    required: true
    default: ''
  workspace:
    description: 'The relative path to the file to run, the workspace'
    required: true
    default: ''

runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.command }}
    - '-w'
    - ${{ inputs.workspace }}
